Changelog
=========

0.3 (2011-02-25)
----------------

- you can now specify a callback without specifying a form to
  send. [vincent]

- added tests for the jQuery plugin. [vincent]

- removed the 'eval()' calls in process_call. Also removed
  arg_to_string not needed anymore and disabled 'clean_string' which
  is also not needed anymore. [vincent]

- extracted sub-methods from the jquery plugin to easy testing. All
  are prefixed with pyproxy_ to avoid name conflicts. [vincent]

- added roadmap. [vincent]

- added extra JS/CSS file to show a spinner when a request is
  done. The spinner image was generated using ajaxload.info/ [vincent] 

- finally added tests for the base python code. Tests for the jquery
  plugin and customized Plone.Django object to come. [vincent+maurits]

- IMPORTANT: the 'grammar' attribute has been renamed 'base_grammar'
  attribute. If you created sub-classes of the JQueryProxy object,
  update them. Using the 'grammar' attribute caused a problem as it
  was not initialized in the __init__ method, the value was spread to
  every instances of the JQueryProxy object. [vincent]

- added a 'batch' method on the JueryProxy object to process multiple
  entries. It should be used to replace show_errors and
  hide_errors. [vincent]

- deprecated jq.show_errors and jq.hide_errors as it was based
  on Plone CSS classes. [vincent]

- moved 'clean_string', 'package_contents' and 'custom_endswith' to
  utils. [vincent]

- small bugfix in Plone version to hide the previous portal
  messages. [vincent]

- updated __init__.py to declare the namespace to avoid problems with
  setuptools 0.7. [vincent]


0.2 (2010-10-22)
----------------

- renamed django.py in jq_django.py as it was giving conflicts when
  importing HttpResponse. [vincent]

- moved jquery.pyproxy.js in a folder called 'media' so it can be used
  easily by django user with django-appmedia. Also added some
  registration for plone users so jquery.pyproxy appears in the
  quick_installer and automatically adds the JS file to the
  jsregistry. [vincent]

- bugfix: fadeOut and fadeIn did not have correct names in
  plugins/jq_effects. [vincent]

- Added 'PreventDefault' in make_call - using 'return false' works for
  links but is not enough for submit buttons. [vincent]
